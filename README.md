This App simulates total worth of an investment over a specified period of time. The underlying equation assumes monthly compounding and also monthly contributions by the user.

The equation I referenced to simulate the value can be found at: https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/articles/finance/compound-interest-formula.php

Since this equation will provide the total value at the end of the period the user specifies, I simply iterated over a year at a time, creating a data point for each year and updating the new total.
